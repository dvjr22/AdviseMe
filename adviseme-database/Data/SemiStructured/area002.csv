Application Area Electives: An application area consists of three courses (9 hours) in a single area offered by another department. This coursework must display a distinct curriculum pattern. If a defined minor exists in the discipline of the application area, then a good set of suggested courses for the application area would be a subset of the minor. A minor (18 hours) can replace the application area electives. Students should consult their advisor to ensure their application area courses will meet this graduation requirement.
