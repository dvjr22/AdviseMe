The Carolina Core provides the common core of knowledge, skill and academic experience for all Carolina undergraduate students. Students in the College of Engineering and Computing are required to demonstrate proficiency in one foreign language equivalent to the 121 course by 1) a score of two or better on the foreign language placement test; or 2) completion of the 109 and 110 courses in FREN, GERM, LATN, or SPAN or completion of the 121 course in another foreign language. Students who do not place out of the GFL requirement may need to take additional hours to meet this requirement. This major map also assumes that students complete one Carolina Core overlay course. Additional hours may be required to meet all Carolina Core requirements if no overlay course is taken
